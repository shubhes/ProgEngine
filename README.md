# ProgEngine

Welcome to the Diesel Engine Fault Prognosis Dataset repository- ProgEngine! This repository contains experimental data collected from an inline 6-cylinder Navistar production DT diesel engine for the purpose of fault diagnosis and performance analysis. The dataset provides valuable insights into the behavior of the engine under various operating conditions and simulated faults in the fuel injector and injection system.

Experimental Setup
The experimental setup involved utilizing an inline 6-cylinder 7.6 L Navistar production DT diesel engine provided by Pure Power Technologies, Inc. The engine was equipped with overhead valves, electro-hydraulic fuel injectors, and a dual-staged turbocharger. Various sensors were strategically installed to measure critical parameters such as airflow rate, fuel flow rate, fuel rail pressure, intake and exhaust pressure, and temperatures at different locations along the intake and exhaust flow paths. These sensors enabled comprehensive data collection to analyze the engine's performance and detect potential cylinder faults.

Data Collection
Data collection was performed using a combination of tools and systems, including an active dynamometer, the AVL PUMA testbed automation system, and the INCA software for engine control and calibration. The dataset includes two types of files for each operating condition:

ECU Save-File: This file contains data from approximately 100 real and virtual sensors monitored by the ECU. The data was collected at a rate of once per engine cycle.

PUMA Test Cell Automation Save-File: This file provides information on test cell conditions such as temperatures, pressures, and flow rates. The data was collected at a sample rate of 10 Hz.

Design of Experiments
The dataset was generated using a structured experimental design at various engine speeds (1000, 1200, 1400, and 1600 RPM). Three types of potential faults related to the fuel injector or injection system were introduced:

Variation in Injection Duration: The injection duration of a single cylinder was increased or decreased from the nominal ECU value. This simulates injector failure scenarios caused by factors such as injector deposits, eroded injector nozzle holes, or solenoid coil/command signal anomalies.

Start of Injection: The injection timing of one of the cylinders was slightly perturbed compared to the ECU-commanded signal.

Injection Pressure Fault: The fuel pressure set-point was adjusted from the ECU command.
